# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Pactus blockchain!
Please read these guidelines before submitting a pull request or opening an issue.

## Code Guidelines

We strive to maintain clean, readable, and maintainable code in Pactus blockchain.
Please follow these guidelines when contributing code to the project:

- Code should follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines.
- Documentation should follow the [Go Doc Comments](https://go.dev/doc/comment) format.
- Follow the principles of clean code as outlined in Robert C. Martin's "[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)" book. Here you can find a [summary](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29) of the book.
- Write tests for new code or changes to existing code, and make sure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Error strings and log messages should not be capitalized (unless beginning with proper nouns or acronyms) and
 SHOULD NOT end with punctuation. Examples:
  * Correct ✅: "unable to connect to server"
  * Incorrect ❌: "Unable to connect to server"
  * Incorrect ❌: "unable to connect to server."

The following commands are available in the Makefile:

- `make build` compiles the code into executable binaries.
- `make devtools` installs required development tools.
- `make fmt` formats the code according to the Go standards.
- `make check` runs various checks on the code, including formatting and linting.
- `make test` performs all the tests including unit tests and system tests.
- `make uint_test` performs only unit tests.
- `make proto` generates [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) files, if you have made any changes to the proto buffer files.

## CLI Guidelines

The help messages for CLI flags should follow this pattern:

- Start all messages with a lowercase letter.
- Avoid stating defaults in the help string, as Cobra automatically adds them.
- Include a range for flags that accept a range of values.

## Commit Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when committing changes to Pactus blockchain:

- Each commit should represent a single, atomic change to the codebase.
  Avoid making multiple unrelated changes in a single commit.
- Commit message should not be longer than 50 characters.
- Commit message should start with lowercase and not ends with punctuation.
- Write commit message in the imperative: "fix bug" and not "fixed bug" or "fixes bug".
- Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for commit messages and Pull Request titles.
